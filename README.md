[How does NFT Work (Easy Explanation w/ No Jargons!)](https://mytnft.com/learn/how-does-nft-work/)

An NFT is a digital asset that links ownership to unique physical or digital assets like artwork, real estate, music, and videos. Fungible objects are easily exchangeable since their value is not related to their rarity.


## Staking NFTs

staking refers to storing digital assets in the form of a ‘stake’ and assigning them to those willing to maintain their upkeep. In return, they give you a share of the reward. You can stake your NFTs to earn rewards and incentives on various sites — one of them being Rplanet.


## Invest in NFT startups

A final way to indirectly make money with non-fungible tokens is through investing in startups.
There’re so many promising NFTs startups that are showcasing great innovations in the crypto world.


## Trade NFTs

You can invest in NFTs by buying them and selling them at a profit. 
Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile, a Miami-based art collector, flipped a Beeple digital art piece almost 1,000 times its initial price in less than 6 months! 

As a collector, you need to look at a piece with a critical eye for the prospects of making money in a future resale.
