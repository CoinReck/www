[How does NFT Work (Easy Explanation w/ No Jargons!)](https://mytnft.com/learn/how-does-nft-work/)

An NFT is a digital asset that links ownership to unique physical or digital assets like artwork, real estate, music, and videos. Fungible objects are easily exchangeable since their value is not related to their rarity.

Creators and investors have made staggering figures that have changed their lives forever. Earlier this year, the 69.3 million sale of Beeple’s NFT broke the internet and changed how the world viewed these digital collectibles.

Everyone is now racing to get their feet in the water to ride this wave. If you’ve been watching from the sidelines not knowing where to start, don’t worry — the boat hasn’t sailed so far yet. Here are 5 ways you can make money with NFTs.


## Staking NFTs

staking refers to storing digital assets in the form of a ‘stake’ and assigning them to those willing to maintain their upkeep. In return, they give you a share of the reward. 
You can stake your NFTs to earn rewards and incentives on various sites


## Invest in NFT startups

A final way to indirectly make money with non-fungible tokens is through investing in startups.
There’re so many promising NFTs startups that are showcasing great innovations in the crypto world.


## Trade NFTs

You can invest in NFTs by buying them and selling them at a profit. 
Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile, a Miami-based art collector, flipped a Beeple digital art piece almost 1,000 times its initial price in less than 6 months! 

As a collector, you need to look at a piece with a critical eye for the prospects of making money in a future resale.

> The provider API itself is very simple, and wraps [Ethereum JSON-RPC](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#json-rpc-methods) [(opens new window)](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#json-rpc-methods) formatted messages, which is why developers usually use a convenience library for interacting with the provider, like [ethers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethers) [(opens new window)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethers), [web3.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3) [(opens new window)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3), [truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) [(opens new window)](https://www.trufflesuite.com/), [Embark](https://framework.embarklabs.io/) [(opens new window)](https://framework.embarklabs.io/), or others. From those tools, you can generally find sufficient documentation to interact with the provider, without reading this lower-level API.
